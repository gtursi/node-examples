node-examples
=============

Repository for proofs of concept, tests, demos and other informal stuff I play with...

See the corresponding README.md files on each project in order to know how to install and run the applications.

# Installation and execution instructions

To run basic examples just run:

`node <example_file>.js`

See console log to get the port where the app is listening.
